# Creating and Using a Keylogger
*Disclaimer: for educational purposes only!!*

## Introduction
in this project, I am going to create and run a keylogger in a controlled Windows 10 virtual machine. I setup the keylogger using Microsoft Visual Studio, using C#.

## Running Keylogger

## Additional Steps
- Setup keylogger to email after a certain limit of characters has been reached
- Change keylogger from Console Application to Windows Application to eliminate the console window (not done on uploaded files for obvious reasons)
- Add myKeylogger.exe to startup files to have it run even if the computer has been restarted.
